# TA Session Guide – Coding Bootcamp

### Goal of the TA Session
- Duration: **1 hour**  
- Purpose: Reinforce learning, provide practice, and create a safe space for questions  
- Key Challenge: Students often feel uncomfortable asking questions  

The TA’s job is **not passive**. You are not just “waiting for questions.” It is your responsibility to guide, engage, and encourage interaction.

## 1. Overcoming the “Fear of Asking”
- **Normalize Questions**: Remind students that “there are no dumb questions.” Share examples of your own past struggles.  
- **Anonymous Questions**: Use tools like Slido, Mentimeter, or a shared doc for students to post questions without names.  
- **Rephrase**: Instead of “Any questions?”, try:  
  - *“What part was the most confusing for you?”*  
  - *“Who can explain this step back to me?”*  
- **Small Group Work**: Break them into pairs for 3 minutes, then ask each pair to share one question.

## 2. Structuring the 1-Hour Session
**Suggested Flow:**  
1. **Warm-up (5 min)** – Quick recap or mini-challenge from last class.  
2. **Guided Practice (20–25 min)** – Work through an exercise step by step with pauses for students to try.  
3. **Interactive Q&A (15 min)** – Invite questions, but also *ask students questions* to trigger discussion.  
4. **Peer Explanation (10 min)** – Have one student explain their solution while others comment.  
5. **Wrap-up (5 min)** – Summarize key points + preview next steps.

## 3. Active Engagement Techniques
- **Ask Before You Answer**: If a student asks, throw the question to the group first.  
- **Cold Calling, Warmly**: Gently ask specific students to share their thinking (rotate, avoid pressure on the same people).  
- **Check Progress**: Walk around (if in-person) or check screens (if online) to spot who is stuck.  
- **Micro-Challenges**: Create short coding challenges to keep energy up.  
- **Celebrate Mistakes**: Treat wrong answers as opportunities to clarify, not failures.

## 4. Creating a Safe & Supportive Space
- Smile, use positive body language, and show patience.  
- Reinforce effort: *“That’s a great attempt, let’s build on it.”*  
- Remind them that struggling is part of coding and everyone is learning.  
- Explicitly say at the start: *“This session is your space to experiment, get stuck, and ask anything—safe zone.”*
