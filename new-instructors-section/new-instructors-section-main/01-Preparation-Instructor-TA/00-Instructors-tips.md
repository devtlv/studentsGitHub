# Instructor Tips: Teaching Adults in a Coding Bootcamp

### Teacher Training Guide

Most of our students are between 20 and 35 years old, coming from diverse backgrounds. Some arrive with previous technical knowledge, while others are complete beginners. Additionally, English is often their second or even third language. This guide highlights the main challenges when teaching this audience and provides practical strategies to help teachers succeed.

## 1. Main Challenges & How to Overcome Them

### Quick List of Challenges
- Language barriers  
- Diverse backgrounds in tech  
- Adult learners’ expectations  
- Engagement & motivation  

---

### 1.1 Language Barriers
* **Challenge:** Students may struggle to follow complex explanations in English.  
* **How to Overcome:**  
  * Use simple, clear language.  
  * Write down key terms and repeat them.  
  * Encourage students to create a personal glossary.  
  * Check understanding by asking them to explain concepts back in their own words.  

### 1.2 Diverse Backgrounds in Tech
* **Challenge:** Some students grasp new coding concepts quickly, while others need more time.  
* **How to Overcome:**  
  * Provide layered explanations: start simple, then go deeper.  
  * Use analogies from everyday life.  
  * Pair stronger students with those who need support (peer learning).  
  * Offer optional advanced challenges for fast learners.  

### 1.3 Adult Learners’ Expectations
* **Challenge:** Adults expect practical results and want to connect learning with real-life use.  
* **How to Overcome:**  
  * Relate exercises to real-world coding tasks.  
  * Highlight employability skills (debugging, problem-solving, teamwork).  
  * Respect their time: explain why each activity is important.  

### 1.4 Engagement & Motivation
* **Challenge:** Some may lose focus due to intensive pace or external responsibilities.  
* **How to Overcome:**  
  * Use interactive methods (live coding, quizzes, polls).  
  * Celebrate small wins (completing an exercise, solving a bug).  
  * Encourage collaboration and create a supportive atmosphere.

## 2. Tips for Starting & Running a Lesson

### Quick List of Tips
- Start with a recap of previous class  
- Connect with questions  
- Use a quick interactive activity  
- Relate to real-world use cases  

---

### 2.1 Start with a Recap
* Quickly review terms and concepts from the last session.  
* Ask: *“Who remembers what we did yesterday and why it’s useful?”*  

### 2.2 Connect with Questions
* Introduce today’s topic by asking a thought-provoking question.  
* Example: *“We know how to write a function. But what if we want to reuse it in another file—how do we do that?”*  

### 2.3 Use a Quick Interactive Activity
* Warm-up with a coding riddle, a debug challenge, or a poll.  

### 2.4 Relate to Real-World Use Cases
* Show where the new concept is applied in industry projects.

## 3. Tips to Ensure Students Follow the Pace

- **Check in Regularly:** After each concept, ask short comprehension questions.  
- **Use Pair Programming:** Have students explain their code to each other.  
- **Observe Non-Verbal Cues:** Confusion often shows before students ask for help.  
- **Encourage Questions:** Normalize “not knowing yet.”  
- **Live Coding + Breaks:** Code step by step, then pause for students to try.  
- **Mini-Recaps Every 30–40 Minutes:** Reinforce before moving on.

## 4. Teacher’s Checklist

### Before & During the Lesson
* [ ] Prepare a simple recap of last class.  
* [ ] Plan a hook question to introduce the new topic.  
* [ ] Write down the key vocabulary on the board/slides.  
* [ ] Check in with students frequently (questions, polls, show of hands).  
* [ ] Balance explanations with practice (no more than 15–20 min of pure lecture).  
* [ ] Encourage peer support and collaboration.  
* [ ] Monitor engagement (body language, participation, coding progress).  

### After the Lesson
* [ ] Summarize key takeaways clearly.  
* [ ] Provide a short practice task or reflection question.  
* [ ] Make sure struggling students know where to get extra support (they can always ask the TA for help).
