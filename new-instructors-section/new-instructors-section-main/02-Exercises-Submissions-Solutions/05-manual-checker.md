# 🖊 Manual Checking of Exercises

While many exercises are evaluated automatically by the **AI-Checker**, there are specific cases where exercises must be **checked manually** by the Checker.  
In these cases:  
- The Checker provides **manual feedback** directly to the student.  
- A **video tutorial** is available to guide you through the manual checking process.

## 📅 When Entire Weeks Are Checked Manually

Some weeks of the program require all exercises to be checked manually.  
Examples:  
- **Tableau Week** (Data Analysis course)  
- **Power BI Week** (Data Analysis course)  

In such cases, the Checker must also complete the **Weekly Grade Report**.

## 📝 Weekly Grade Report Process

1. Open the **Weekly Grade Report** form. *(image example here)*  
2. Select the **relevant cohort** and the **week number**.  
3. Add your **feedback manually** for each student.

Then add the grade from 1 to 5 being 1 very low and 5 very good and your written feedback about that week for each student.
On the end of the page you will find the button "submit all" to save all the feedbacks you added.

⚠️ **Important:** Manual checking requires more detail than AI-Checker results. Make sure your feedback is clear, constructive, and directly tied to the student’s work.
