# 🕘 Daily Routine Overview

A consistent daily routine is essential during the bootcamp.  
Because the program is **intensive and fast-paced**, both students and staff benefit from an organized structure.  
- Students know what to expect, which helps them **prepare mentally and academically** for each session.  
- Instructors and TAs can better **manage their time and tasks**, ensuring no important step is skipped.  
- The routine fosters consistency, which reduces confusion and allows everyone to focus on learning.
