# Exploring Different HTTP Methods

## What You Will Learn

In this lesson, you will explore various HTTP methods and their uses. You will learn how to retrieve data using the GET method, submit data with the POST method, update data with the PUT method, and delete data using the DELETE method. Additionally, you will see examples of how to apply these methods in JavaScript.

## What Is...

### HTTP Methods Overview

HTTP defines several methods, also referred to as verbs, to indicate the desired action to be performed on a resource. These include:

- **GET**: Retrieves data from the server and sends data in the URL parameters. It does not include a request body.
- **POST**: Submits data to the server for processing and sends data in the request body. It is often used for form submissions or creating new resources.
- **PUT**: Updates an existing resource on the server by sending data in the request body, typically replacing the entire resource.
- **DELETE**: Removes a resource from the server and does not include a request body. It is used to delete a specific resource.

### Example Using GET Method

Here is an example of fetching user data from the server using the GET method:

```javascript
fetch("https://api.example.com/users?id=123", {
  method: "GET",
})
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
  .catch((error) => console.error("Error:", error));
```

### Example Using POST Method

Here is an example of submitting form data to create a new user using the POST method:

```javascript
fetch("https://api.example.com/users", {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({ username: "exampleUser", email: "user@example.com" }),
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
})
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
  .catch((error) => console.error("Error:", error));
```

### Example Using PUT Method

Here is an example of updating user information using the PUT method:

```javascript
fetch("https://api.example.com/users/123", {
  method: "PUT",
  body: JSON.stringify({ username: "updatedUser", email: "updated@example.com" }),
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
})
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
  .catch((error) => console.error("Error:", error));
```

### Example Using DELETE Method

Here is an example of deleting a user using the DELETE method:

```javascript
fetch("https://api.example.com/users/123", {
  method: "DELETE",
})
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
  .catch((error) => console.error("Error:", error));
```

## Conclusion

In this lesson, you learned about the different HTTP methods—GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE—and their specific uses in interacting with web servers. Understanding how to use these methods appropriately will help you work efficiently with server-side resources and build dynamic, responsive web applications. By practicing with examples, you can further enhance your understanding and skill in utilizing these HTTP methods.
