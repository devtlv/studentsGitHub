# Understanding JavaScript Call Stack, Event Loop, and Queue

## What You Will Learn

In this lesson, you will learn about the three key concepts in JavaScript that handle asynchronous and concurrent operations: the Call Stack, Event Loop, and Queue. Understanding how these mechanisms work together is essential for writing efficient, responsive, and scalable JavaScript applications.

## What Is...

### Call Stack

The Call Stack is a Last In, First Out (LIFO) data structure that tracks function calls during the execution of a script. The last function added to the stack is the first one to be executed and removed.

### Event Loop

The Event Loop is a core concept in JavaScript's concurrency model. It continuously checks the call stack and callback queue, pushing eligible callbacks from the queue onto the stack for execution when the stack is empty.

### Queue

The Queue, often referred to as the Callback Queue or Task Queue, is a data structure that stores callbacks of asynchronous tasks until they are ready to be executed.

## Understanding...

### Call Stack

When a function is called, a new frame is added to the top of the call stack to represent the function's execution context. As functions return, their corresponding frames are popped off the stack.

For example:

```javascript
function foo() {
  console.log("foo");
}

function bar() {
  console.log("bar");
  foo();
}

bar();
```

In this code, `bar()` is called and its frame is added to the call stack. Inside `bar()`, `foo()` is called, so its frame is added on top of `bar()`'s frame. Once `foo()` returns, its frame is popped off, followed by `bar()`'s frame.

### Event Loop

When an asynchronous task, such as a timer or an I/O operation, completes, its callback is pushed onto the callback queue. The Event Loop waits for the call stack to be empty, then moves callbacks from the queue to the stack for execution.

For example:

```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Timeout callback");
}, 1000);

console.log("Hello");
```

In this example, `'Hello'` is logged immediately, while the `setTimeout` callback is added to the callback queue. After 1 second, when the stack is empty, the Event Loop moves the callback from the queue to the stack for execution.

### Queue

When an asynchronous task completes, its callback is placed in the queue. The Event Loop continuously checks if the call stack is empty and then moves callbacks from the queue to the stack for execution.

## Practical Example

Here is an example that demonstrates how the Call Stack, Event Loop, and Queue work together in JavaScript:

```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Callback 1");
}, 0);

console.log("Synchronous Code");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Callback 2");
}, 0);
```

In this example, `"Synchronous Code"` will be printed first, followed by `"Callback 1"` and `"Callback 2"`, as the setTimeout callbacks will be placed in the queue and executed later.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the Call Stack, Event Loop, and Queue are fundamental components of JavaScript's concurrency model. They enable JavaScript to handle asynchronous tasks efficiently and ensure applications remain responsive and performant. Understanding how these mechanisms work together will allow you to write code that fully utilizes JavaScript's asynchronous nature, resulting in robust and scalable applications.
