## Description

ðŸ”§ Sharpen your Redux skills and embark on an exciting journey into Redux Toolkit to build powerful state management solutions for your React applications! ðŸš€ Learn to efficiently manage application state, handle complex data flows, and enhance your React projects with Redux Toolkit's simplified syntax and powerful features.

### What You'll Learn

- **Redux Store Setup:** Set up a Redux store using Redux Toolkit, including middleware and reducers, to manage the state of your application effectively.

- **Initial State Definition:** Define the initial state of your application using Redux Toolkit's `createSlice` function, organizing data such as todos, movies, or product inventory.

- **Selectors Creation:** Utilize `createSelector` from `@reduxjs/toolkit` to create selectors for efficiently querying and filtering data from the Redux store, enhancing performance and maintainability.

- **Component Implementation:** Create React components to interact with the Redux store, such as TodoList, MovieList, or ProductList, to display and manage data according to user actions.

- **UI Interaction:** Implement dynamic UI interactions within React components to demonstrate Redux functionality, allowing users to add, remove, filter, or sort data seamlessly.

- **Bonus (Optional):** Enhance your application by implementing additional features, such as sorting functionality for movies or products, to further improve user experience and showcase your skills.
