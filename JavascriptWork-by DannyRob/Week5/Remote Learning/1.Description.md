## Description

If you are into web development, user interface design, or front-end engineering, understanding DOM manipulation is crucial. üñ•Ô∏è The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents that represents the structure of HTML and XML documents. JavaScript is commonly used for DOM manipulation to dynamically update the content, structure, and style of web pages based on user interactions or application requirements. üí° Functions are a fundamental concept in JavaScript, allowing you to encapsulate reusable pieces of code and execute them whenever needed. üõ†Ô∏è Understanding how to define, call, and utilize functions is essential for building modular, maintainable, and scalable applications. üöÄ
