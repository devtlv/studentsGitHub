# Getting Started with Node.js

## Introduction

Node.js is a powerful runtime environment for running JavaScript code outside of a web browser. If you're new to Node.js, this guide will walk you through the basics, including installation, basic commands, and understanding key concepts like the `package.json` file.

## Installation

### Windows

1. Visit the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the Windows installer.
2. Run the installer and follow the prompts to install Node.js.
3. Once installation is complete, open Command Prompt or PowerShell and type `node -v` to verify that Node.js is installed correctly.

### macOS

1. You can install Node.js on macOS using Homebrew. Open Terminal and run the following command:

   ```bash
   brew install node
   ```

2. After installation, you can verify the installation by typing `node -v` in Terminal.

### Linux

1. On most Linux distributions, you can install Node.js using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install nodejs
   ```

2. After installation, verify that Node.js is installed by typing `node -v` in the terminal.

## Basic Commands

### Running Scripts

To run a JavaScript file using Node.js, use the `node` command followed by the filename.

```bash
node filename.js
```

### Node REPL

Node.js comes with a Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL), which allows you to execute JavaScript code interactively. Simply type `node` in the terminal to enter the REPL.

```bash
node
```

### Installing Packages

Node.js has a vast ecosystem of packages available through npm (Node Package Manager). You can install packages locally or globally using the `npm install` command.

```bash
npm install package-name
```

For example, to install the popular `lodash` package globally:

```bash
npm install -g lodash
```

### Creating a New Project

To create a new Node.js project, navigate to the desired directory in your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm init
```

This command will walk you through creating a `package.json` file for your project, which contains metadata about your project and its dependencies.

## Understanding package.json

### What is package.json?

The `package.json` file is a metadata file for your Node.js project. It contains information such as the project's name, version, description, entry point, dependencies, and scripts. It's used by npm to manage the project's dependencies and scripts.

### Creating package.json

You can create a `package.json` file for your project using the `npm init` command. It will prompt you to enter various details about your project, such as its name, version, description, entry point, etc.

```bash
npm init
```

### Example package.json

Here's an example `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A simple Node.js project",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1"
  }
}
```

- **name**: The name of your project.
- **version**: The version number of your project.
- **description**: A brief description of your project.
- **main**: The entry point of your application (usually `index.js`).
- **scripts**: Custom scripts that can be run using `npm run <script-name>`.
- **dependencies**: The list of dependencies required by your project.
