## Why Global State Management is Useful

In complex web applications, managing state can become challenging, especially when multiple components need access to the same data or when data needs to persist across different parts of the application. This is where global state management becomes invaluable.

### Benefits of Global State Management:

1. **Centralized State**: Global state management systems like Redux provide a centralized store where all application state resides. This makes it easier to track and manage state changes across the application.

2. **Share State Across Components**: With global state, you can share state across different components without passing props down through multiple levels of the component tree. This simplifies component interactions and reduces coupling between components.

3. **Persistence**: Global state can persist across different routes or pages of the application. This is especially useful for user authentication, shopping cart items, or other data that needs to remain consistent across the entire application.

4. **Ease of Testing**: Since global state is centralized and decoupled from individual components, it becomes easier to test state-related functionality in isolation. This improves the overall testability and maintainability of the application.

## What is Redux Toolkit?

Redux Toolkit is the official, recommended toolset for building Redux applications. It simplifies the process of setting up a Redux store, defining reducers, and writing immutable update logic by providing a set of utility functions and APIs.

## Understanding Redux Toolkit

Redux Toolkit offers several key features to streamline Redux development:

1. **`configureStore`**: This API simplifies the creation of a Redux store by automatically configuring it with good default settings and enabling the Redux DevTools extension for easier debugging.

2. **`createSlice`**: This function generates Redux slice reducers, which encapsulate the initial state and reducer functions for a specific part of your Redux state. It allows you to write "mutating" update logic using Immer, which produces correct immutable updates.

3. **React-Redux Integration**: Redux Toolkit seamlessly integrates with React-Redux, allowing you to provide the Redux store to your React components using the `<Provider>` component and access Redux state and dispatch actions using React-Redux hooks.

## Practical Example: Setting Up a Redux Store

### Step 1: Install Redux Toolkit and React-Redux

```bash
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```

### Step 2: Create a Redux Store

Create a file named `src/app/store.js` and configure the Redux store using `configureStore`:

```javascript
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {},
});
```

### Step 3: Provide the Redux Store to React

Wrap your `<App>` component with the `<Provider>` component in `src/index.js`:

```javascript
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import { store } from "./app/store";

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

### Step 4: Create a Redux State Slice

Create a file named `src/features/counter/counterSlice.js` and define a counter slice with `createSlice`:

```javascript
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: "counter",
  initialState: { value: 0 },
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => {
      state.value += 1;
    },
    decrement: (state) => {
      state.value -= 1;
    },
    incrementByAmount: (state, action) => {
      state.value += action.payload;
    },
  },
});
```

### Step 5: Add Slice Reducers to the Store

Import the counter reducer and add it to the Redux store in `src/app/store.js`:

```javascript
import counterReducer from "../features/counter/counterSlice";

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    counter: counterReducer,
  },
});
```

### Step 6: Use Redux State and Actions in React Components

Create a `<Counter>` component in `src/features/counter/Counter.js` to interact with Redux state and actions:

```javascript
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from "react-redux";
import { increment, decrement } from "./counterSlice";

export function Counter() {
  const count = useSelector((state) => state.counter.value);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}>Increment</button>
      <span>{count}</span>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(decrement())}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've learned how to set up a Redux application with Redux Toolkit. You now have the foundational knowledge to build scalable and maintainable Redux-powered applications.
