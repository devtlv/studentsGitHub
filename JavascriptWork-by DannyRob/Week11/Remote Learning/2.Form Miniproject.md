### Creating a Dynamic Form Component in React with TypeScript

**Objective:**  
In this assignment, you will develop a dynamic form component in React using TypeScript. This exercise will enhance your understanding of managing various types of form inputs dynamically based on a configuration object. You'll also master state management and validation techniques crucial for creating a seamless user experience.

### Instructions

#### 1. Setting Up the Project

**Folder Route:** `src/components/Form`

**Task:** Set up a new React project with TypeScript and create a folder structure for your form component.

1. Create a new React project using Create React App with TypeScript.

   ```bash
   npx create-react-app dynamic-form --template typescript
   cd dynamic-form
   ```

2. Create the folder structure for your form component.
   ```bash
   mkdir -p src/components/Form
   ```

#### 2. Creating the Configuration Object

**Folder Route:** `src/components/Form/config.ts`

**Task:** Create a configuration object that defines the form's layout, including input types, labels, names, options, and validation rules.

1. Create a file named `config.ts` inside the `Form` folder.

2. Define a configuration object that includes various input types (e.g., text, email, select), labels, names, options, and validation rules.

#### 3. Building the Dynamic Form Component

**Folder Route:** `src/components/Form/DynamicForm.tsx`

**Task:** Develop a React component capable of rendering form inputs dynamically based on the configuration object.

1. Create a new file named `DynamicForm.tsx` inside the `Form` folder.

2. Write a component that reads the configuration object and renders form inputs based on the specified types (e.g., text input for type 'text', select input for type 'select').

#### 4. Managing Form State Dynamically

**Folder Route:** `src/components/Form/DynamicForm.tsx`

**Task:** Utilize React's state management techniques (e.g., `useState` hook) to handle form values dynamically.

1. Update the `DynamicForm` component to include state variables that store form values.

2. Ensure the state updates accurately as users interact with the form inputs.

#### 5. Implementing Dynamic Validation

**Folder Route:** `src/components/Form/DynamicForm.tsx`

**Task:** Write validation logic to validate form inputs based on the rules specified in the configuration object.

1. Add validation functions that check input values against validation rules (e.g., required fields, minimum length, maximum length).

2. Display validation messages dynamically to provide immediate feedback to users.

#### 6. Handling Form Submission

**Folder Route:** `src/components/Form/DynamicForm.tsx`

**Task:** Implement a submission handler function to collect form data.

1. Write a function that collects and processes form data when the user submits the form.

2. Log the collected data to the console or display it below the form for verification.

#### 7. Enhancing User Experience with Styling

**Folder Route:** `src/components/Form/DynamicForm.tsx` and `src/components/Form/DynamicForm.css`

**Task:** Apply CSS styling to the form component to enhance its visual appeal and usability.

1. Create a CSS file named `DynamicForm.css` inside the `Form` folder.

2. Add CSS styles to the form inputs, labels, and buttons to improve the overall look and feel of the form.

3. Ensure that the styling aligns with best practices for user interface design, making the form intuitive and easy to use.

### Summary

By following these steps, you will create a dynamic form component in React with TypeScript. This component will render inputs based on a configuration object, manage state dynamically, validate inputs, handle form submission, and include styling to enhance user experience.
