## Description

For those venturing into backend development, Node.js is indispensable. 🚀 It's a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, enabling server-side JavaScript execution. With its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, Node.js efficiently handles concurrent requests, making it ideal for high-performance web applications. 🌐

Understanding middleware like Multer for file uploads and managing CORS policies is crucial in Node.js development. 🛠️ Multer simplifies multipart/form-data handling, while effectively handling CORS policies ensures secure communication between different origins. 🛡️

Delving into the internals, grasping the JavaScript event loop is essential. 🔄 It enables Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations, facilitating asynchronous programming. Mastering the event loop empowers developers to build scalable Node.js applications. 💡
