### What are Interfaces:

In TypeScript, interfaces are used to define the shape of objects. They describe the structure of an object by specifying the names and types of its properties. Interfaces are used to enforce a contract that objects must adhere to, making it easier to work with complex data structures.

### Understanding Interfaces:

#### Defining Interfaces:

Interfaces are defined using the `interface` keyword. They can contain properties, methods, and index signatures. For example:

```typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  age: number;
}
```

In this example, the `User` interface defines the structure of a user object with `id`, `name`, and `age` properties.

#### Optional Properties:

Properties in interfaces can be marked as optional by appending a `?` to their names. Optional properties may or may not be present in the object. For example:

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age?: number;
}
```

In this case, the `age` property is optional.

#### Readonly Properties:

Properties in interfaces can be marked as readonly using the `readonly` modifier. Readonly properties can only be assigned a value when they are first created. For example:

```typescript
interface Point {
  readonly x: number;
  readonly y: number;
}
```

In this case, the `x` and `y` properties are readonly.

#### Extending Interfaces:

Interfaces can extend other interfaces to inherit their properties. This allows for code reuse and composition. For example:

```typescript
interface Shape {
  color: string;
}

interface Circle extends Shape {
  radius: number;
}
```

In this example, the `Circle` interface extends the `Shape` interface, inheriting its `color` property.

### Practical Example: Working with Interfaces

1. **Defining Interfaces**:

   - Create a file named `interfaces.ts` in the root directory.
   - Define custom interfaces to describe object shapes.

   ```typescript
   // interfaces.ts
   export interface User {
     id: number;
     name: string;
     age: number;
   }

   export interface Point {
     x: number;
     y: number;
   }
   ```

2. **Using Interfaces**:

   - Import the interfaces and use them in your code.

   ```typescript
   // main.ts
   import { User, Point } from "./interfaces";

   const user: User = { id: 1, name: "John", age: 30 };
   const point: Point = { x: 10, y: 20 };
   ```

### Conclusion:

In this lesson, you've learned about interfaces in TypeScript and their role in defining object shapes and enforcing a contract. By working with practical examples, you've gained hands-on experience in defining and using interfaces in TypeScript. Interfaces provide a powerful mechanism for describing complex data structures and promoting code maintainability and readability.
