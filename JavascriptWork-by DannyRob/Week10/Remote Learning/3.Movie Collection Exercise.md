### ðŸŒŸ Exercise 2: Movie Collection Organizer

**Overview**:
In this exercise, you'll create a movie collection organizer application using Redux Toolkit. The application will maintain information about various movies, including their titles, directors, and genres.

**Set up Redux Store**:

1. **Create Redux Store**: Start by establishing a Redux store with necessary middleware and reducers to manage the movie collection state. Redux Toolkit (`@reduxjs/toolkit`) will streamline the setup process, ensuring efficient state management.

   - **Folder**: `src`
   - **File**: `store.js`
   - **Dependencies**: `@reduxjs/toolkit`

   **Explanation**: The Redux store serves as the centralized hub for managing the movie collection data. Setting up the store with Redux Toolkit simplifies state management and enhances scalability.

**Define Initial State**:

2. **Set Initial State**: Define the initial state with an array of movies, each containing properties like id, title, director, and genre. Utilize Redux Toolkit's `createSlice` function to establish the initial state structure efficiently.

   - **Folder**: `src/features/movies`
   - **File**: `moviesSlice.js`

   **Explanation**: Defining the initial state ensures consistency in managing movie data throughout the application. By utilizing Redux Toolkit's `createSlice`, we reduce boilerplate code and enhance code readability.

**Selectors Creation**:

3. **Create Selectors**: Employ `createSelector` from `@reduxjs/toolkit` to create selectors for filtering movies based on genres and directors. Selectors streamline data querying and filtering from the Redux store, improving performance and maintainability.

   - **Folder**: `src/features/movies`
   - **File**: `movieSelectors.js`

   **Explanation**: Selectors abstract away the logic for filtering movies based on genres and directors, making it easier to access specific subsets of data. By separating concerns, selectors enhance code maintainability and readability.

**Component Implementation**:

4. **Implement MovieList Component**: Develop a React component named `MovieList` responsible for rendering the movie collection. Components serve as the visual representation of data, facilitating user interaction and data presentation. Ensure React (`react`) and React Redux (`react-redux`) are installed.

   - **Folder**: `src/components`
   - **File**: `MovieList.js`
   - **Dependencies**: `react`, `react-redux`

   **Explanation**: The MovieList component plays a pivotal role in presenting the movie collection to users. By encapsulating this functionality within a reusable component, we promote code reusability and maintainability.

**UI Interaction**:

5. **Implement UI Interactions**: Incorporate UI interactions within the MovieList component to demonstrate selector functionality. This involves updating the UI dynamically based on user actions, such as selecting genres or directors.

   - **Folder**: `src/components`
   - **File**: `MovieList.js`

   **Explanation**: UI interactions enrich the user experience by allowing users to interact with and explore the movie collection. Integrating Redux with React components ensures seamless state management and UI updates.

**Test and Validate**:

6. **Test Functionality**: Validate the functionality by testing different scenarios, such as switching between genres and directors, and verifying that the movie list updates correctly. Testing ensures that the application behaves as expected across various scenarios.

   **Explanation**: Testing guarantees the reliability and correctness of the movie collection organizer application. By thoroughly validating the functionality, we ensure a robust and bug-free user experience.

**End File Structure**:

Upon completing the exercise, the final file structure should adhere to the following organization:

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ MovieList.js
â”œâ”€â”€ features/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ movies/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ moviesSlice.js
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ movieSelectors.js
â””â”€â”€ store.js
```

This structured organization enhances clarity and maintainability, with components, reducers, selectors, and the Redux store neatly organized within the project directory.
